---To know the current database owner
Select name, 
Suser_sname (owner_sid) AS DBOwnername
From master.sys.databases

--- To change owner to SA  in single database

Use [DBNAME]
Go
Exec Sp_changedbowner 'SA'

--- To change all databases with non "SA" owners: the below script gives you the query to change all databases (copy-paste and run)

use master
go
select 'use [' + db.name+']; exec sp_changedbowner [sa];' from 
sys.databases db left join sys.server_principals sp
on db.owner_sid=sp.sid
where sp.name <>'sa'
